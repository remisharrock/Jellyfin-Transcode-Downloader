A Jellyfin **server plugin** that adds a quality-selection transcoded download option to the
More menu on item detail pages. Pick a video codec, an audio codec and a quality tier, and
Jellyfin transcodes the file on the fly. Use Jellyfin's built-in Download button to grab the
original file.

> This fork adds **video and audio codec selection** (HEVC and AV1 alongside H.264, Opus

## What this fork adds

The download dialog gains a **codec picker** above the quality tiers:

| | Original | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| Video codec | H.264 only (hardcoded) | H.264 · HEVC · AV1 |
| Audio codec | AAC only (hardcoded) | AAC · Opus |
| Encoder availability | n/a | Probed server-side before the codec is offered |
| Bitrate tiers | Absolute | Codec-relative (HEVC ≈ 65%, AV1 ≈ 50% of the H.264 target) |

Why the probe matters: Jellyfin resolves a software encoder such as `libsvtav1` or `libx265`
*without* checking that FFmpeg actually ships it. Requesting a codec the server cannot encode
is accepted and then dies mid-transcode. A new authenticated `GET /TranscodeDownloader/Codecs`
endpoint calls `IMediaEncoder.SupportsEncoder` and honours the administrator's
`AllowHevcEncoding` / `AllowAv1Encoding` toggles, so unavailable codecs are disabled in the
picker instead of failing halfway through a download.

**Measured on an Intel Arc GPU** (hardware AV1 encoding), one episode:

| | Size |
|---|---|
| Original file | ~600 MB |
| H.264 download | 122 MB |
| AV1 + Opus download | **84 MB** |

## How to download

![Demo](demo/jellyfin-demo.gif)

After installing the plugin, open any **movie or episode detail page** in the Jellyfin web
client. Open the **"More" menu** (the `⋯` / kebab menu on the detail page) — a
**"Download (Transcode…)"** entry appears at the bottom of the list.

Selecting it opens a quality picker. Choose a video codec, an audio codec and a bitrate tier —
Jellyfin transcodes on the fly and the plugin downloads the stream with a live progress bar.
To grab the original file without transcoding, use Jellyfin's own **Download** button that's
already in the More menu.

You can queue multiple items: navigate to another movie or episode and add more downloads
while one is already in progress. Each queued item waits its turn and starts automatically
when the one ahead of it finishes.

### Choosing a codec

![Codec picker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f9dab93-f25e-49d4-974a-0f7e13329da5)

The picker offers **H.264 (AVC)**, **HEVC (H.265)** and **AV1** for video, and **AAC** or
**Opus** for audio. H.264/AAC is the default and plays everywhere. Your last choice is
remembered in the browser, so you only pick it once.

The bitrate tiers are **codec-relative**: they are calibrated for H.264, and HEVC (≈ 65%) and
AV1 (≈ 50%) targets are scaled down so a given rung means roughly the same picture quality on
every codec. Picking "1080p" on AV1 therefore produces a smaller file than on H.264, not a
worse-looking one.

A codec is shown greyed out, with the reason spelled out underneath, when:

- **it isn't supported by this server's FFmpeg** — Jellyfin resolves e.g. AV1 to `libsvtav1`,
  but not every FFmpeg build includes it. The plugin asks the server which encoders actually
  exist rather than letting the download start and die halfway through.
- **it's disabled by the server administrator** — HEVC and AV1 encoding are governed by
  **Dashboard → Playback → "Allow encoding in HEVC format" / "Allow encoding in AV1 format"**,
  and **both are off by default**. An administrator has to turn them on before those codecs
  become selectable here.

If a codec resolves to a **software encoder** (`libx265`, `libsvtav1`), the picker says so. A
software AV1 transcode of a long 4K film can run for hours, and the download is held in the
browser's memory until it finishes.

Two playback caveats worth knowing before picking something exotic:

- **HEVC in MP4** is written by Jellyfin with the `hev1` tag rather than `hvc1`. VLC, mpv and
  ffmpeg play it fine; Apple QuickTime and Safari generally will not.
- **Opus in MP4** is likewise well supported by VLC, mpv, Chrome and Firefox, but not by
  Apple's players. Pick AAC if the file has to play on an Apple device.

### What happens in the background

Jellyfin encodes the video server-side to the selected codec and bitrate and streams the
result. The plugin downloads the stream chunk by chunk, shows a live progress bar with an
estimated file size, and saves it as an `.mp4` once complete. The chosen codecs and bitrate
are recorded in the filename, e.g. `Movie (2020) [AV1 4Mbps AAC].mp4`, so files downloaded at
different settings don't collide.

The estimated file size shown during a transcoded download is calculated from the selected
bitrate and the item's runtime (`~size = bitrate × duration ÷ 8`). It carries a `~`
prefix because VBR encoding means the real size can vary by ±10–15%.

### Download queue

A panel in the bottom-right corner shows all queued downloads, each labelled with its codecs
and bitrate. The active item displays a progress bar; items waiting to start show "Waiting…".
Each item has its own **✕** cancel button — cancelling removes only that item and the next one
starts automatically. The panel disappears when the queue is empty.

The queue is in-memory only: closing or reloading the browser tab clears it.

Cancelling mid-download aborts the in-progress request cleanly; no partial file is saved.

## How it works

The plugin embeds a small client script and serves it from a plugin API endpoint
(`GET /TranscodeDownloader/ClientScript`). It then injects a single `<script>` tag into the
Jellyfin web client's `index.html` — **in memory**, via the File Transformation companion
plugin, so it never writes to Jellyfin's web directory. This is what makes it work on
standard package and Docker installs where the web root is read-only, and it survives
Jellyfin web updates.

A second endpoint, `GET /TranscodeDownloader/Codecs`, reports which video and audio encoders
this server's FFmpeg actually has and which the administrator permits. Unlike the script and
translation endpoints it requires a logged-in session, because it exposes server encoding
configuration. If it is unreachable the picker quietly falls back to H.264/AAC only.

## Requirements

- **Jellyfin 10.11.x** (built against the 10.11.8 SDK; ABI floor `10.11.8.0`).
- **File Transformation plugin** (>= **v2.2.1.0**) — strongly recommended (see below).
- For HEVC or AV1 downloads: an FFmpeg build with the matching encoder, **and** the
  corresponding **Dashboard → Playback** toggle enabled (both are off by default).

### Installing File Transformation (one-time)

1. In Jellyfin: **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories → Add**, then add the File
   Transformation plugin repository.
2. **Dashboard → Plugins → Catalog**, install **File Transformation**.
3. Restart Jellyfin.

> Without File Transformation, the plugin falls back to patching `index.html` on disk.
> On most installs that directory is **read-only**, so the fallback fails and the button
> will not appear — the server log will say so and recommend installing File Transformation.
> **No filesystem permission changes are needed** when File Transformation is installed.

## Installing Transcode Downloader

> These URLs point at **this fork**, and are what you want if you need the codec picker
> today. For the original plugin without codec selection, use the
> [upstream repository](https://github.com/ph15ch/Jellyfin-Transcode-Downloader) instead.
> Add **one** of the two — this fork and upstream publish the same plugin GUID, so
> registering both makes Jellyfin show duplicate, conflicting catalog entries.

### Production (stable releases)

1. Add this plugin's repository URL under **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories**:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remisharrock/Jellyfin-Transcode-Downloader/main/repo/manifest.json
   ```
2. Install **Transcode Downloader** from the catalog.
3. Restart Jellyfin.

### Testing (pre-release builds)

To follow test/pre-release builds, use the testing manifest instead:

1. Add the **testing** repository URL under **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories**:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remisharrock/Jellyfin-Transcode-Downloader/main/repo/manifest-testing.json
   ```
2. Install **Transcode Downloader** from the catalog.
3. Restart Jellyfin.

> Test builds may be unstable. They are marked as pre-releases on GitHub and only appear in
> the testing manifest — users on the production manifest are never affected.

After restart, open a movie or episode detail page and open the More menu — **"Download (Transcode…)"** appears in the list. (`[TranscodeDownloader] plugin loaded` prints in the browser console.)

## Building from source

```
dotnet publish src/JellyfinTranscodeDownloader.csproj -c Release -o publish/ -p:Version=1.2.3
```

The output `Jellyfin.Plugin.TranscodeDownloader.dll` is the entire plugin (the client
script is an embedded resource).

## Creating a release

Releases are fully tag-driven — no manual edits to the manifest or workflow inputs needed.

### Production release

1. **Write the changelog** as the message of an annotated git tag:
   ```
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Short description of what changed"
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

2. **The `Release` workflow fires automatically** and:
   - Validates the tag is annotated (lightweight tags are rejected)
   - Builds with `dotnet publish -p:Version=1.2.3`
   - Zips the DLL → `jellyfin-transcode-downloader_1.2.3.zip`
   - Prepends a new version entry to `repo/manifest.json` on `main`
   - Creates a GitHub release and uploads the zip

### Test release

Use the `test/vX.Y.Z.N` tag prefix (note the **4-component version**). This triggers a
separate workflow that writes **only** to `repo/manifest-testing.json` and marks the
GitHub release as a pre-release. The production `repo/manifest.json` is never touched.

```
git tag -a test/v1.2.3.1 -m "Short description of what changed"
git push origin test/v1.2.3.1
```

The first three components (`X.Y.Z`) match the upcoming production release; `N` is an
iteration counter starting at 1. For example, test builds leading up to `v1.0.23` would
be `test/v1.0.23.1`, `test/v1.0.23.2`, etc. The workflow enforces 4 components and
rejects 3-component tags.

The `Release (Testing)` workflow runs identically to the production one, except:
- The zip is named `jellyfin-transcode-downloader_1.2.3.1-test.zip`
- The manifest entry goes into `repo/manifest-testing.json`
- The GitHub release is marked as a pre-release

> **Versions are immutable within each manifest** — pushing a tag whose version already
> exists in the target manifest will hard-fail the workflow. Cut a new tag to re-release.
